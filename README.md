# CoffeeEngine
A Java based game engine based off LWJGL(Light-Weight Java Game Library)

This game engine's aim is to be simple to use/understand/intuit and obfuscate raw OpenGL(Graphics)/OpenAL(Audio) calls (with no graphical user interface.)

To use this engine download load [this repository](https://github.com/Crosslywere/CoffeeEngine) and run `mvn clean install` inside the directory.
Then see the [example projects](https://github.com/Crosslywere/CoffeeEngineTest) for how to create your own application.
